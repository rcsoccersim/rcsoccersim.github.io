- 📄 **Title**: CYRUS Soccer Simulation 2D Team DescriptionPaper 2021
- ✍️ **Authors**: Nader Zare, Aref Sayareh, Mahtab Sarvmaili, Omid Amini, Am´ılca Soares, and Stan Matwin
- 📜 **Abstract**: In this report, we briefly present the technical procedure and simulation steps for the 2D soccer simulation of team Cyrus. We emphasize on this document on how the prediction of teammates’ behavior is performed. In our proposed method, the agent receives the noisy inputs from the server, and predicts the ball holder full state behavior. Taking advantage of this approach for choosing the optimal view angle shows 11.30% improvement on the expected win rate.

In particular, we are interested in applying reinforcement learning methods, where the training signal is only given in terms of success or failure. In this paper, we review some of our recent efforts1 putting a special focus on a new Python-based framework for performing reinforcement learning experiments in the context of 2D soccer simulation.

### [HELIOS2021](./TDP_HELIOS2021.pdf)
- 📄 **Title**: HELIOS2021: Team Description Paper
- ✍️ **Authors**: Masaki Yamaguchi, Ryota Kuga, Hiroki Omori, Takuya Fukushima, Tomoharu Nakashima, and Hidehisa Akiyama
- 📜 **Abstract**:  This team description paper introduces the overview of the previous works and the recent research themes of Team HELIOS2021. We have been working on the improvement of statistical team performance indicators (e.g., winning rate and the average of scored goals) by considering the difference in the abilities between our and opponent’s player agents. We propose a method that takes such ability-difference into account to swap the positions within our team. We also present an team evaluation system which has a client server architecture, which automatically perform a lot of games and analyze the game results through the interaction with a human operator. This team evaluation system can also be extended to develop an online competition manager.

This paper brings what we developed until now that made us achieve the position of one of the main 2D Soccer teams in Brazil. Most of the advances described here were inspired in the Gliders2D source code, that are: the pressing and blocking behavior, the evaluator algorithm for defensive and attack purposes and the implementation of better player’s positioning behaviour. Besides that, we also modified and created new formations using the Fedit2 editor. All those changes combined allowed the team to achieve better defensive results in comparison with Gliders2D v1.5.

In the formation, player movement, passing analysis, shooting strategy, offensive and defensive judgment as well as other aspects have achieved some results. The development of YuShan 2020 is depended on YuShan base, and YuShan base is based on the reconstruction project of agent-2d3.1.0 [1], mainly including attack module and defense module.
