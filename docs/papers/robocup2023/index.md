- 📄 **Title**: Observation Denoising in CYRUS Soccer Simulation 2D Team For RoboCup 2023
- ✍️ **Authors**:  Aref Sayareh, Nader Zare, Omid Amini, Arad Firouzkouhi, Mahtab Sarvmaili, Stan Matwin, and Amilcar Soares
- 📜 **Abstract**: The RoboCup competitions hold various leagues, and the Soccer Simulation 2D League is a major one among them. Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) match involves two teams, including 11 players and a coach, competing against each other. The players can only communicate with the Soccer Simulation Server during the game. This paper presents the latest research of the CYRUS soccer simulation 2D team, the champion of RoboCup 2021. We will explain our denoising idea powered by long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and deep neural networks (DNN). The CYRUS team uses the CYRUS2D base code that was developed based on the Helios and Gliders bases.

- 📜 **Abstract**: The RoboCup competition is an international platform where teams compete in various robotic challenges with the ultimate goal of developing autonomous robots that can play soccer against each other. The Soccer Simulation 2D game is one of the challenges in which teams develop algorithms to control virtual soccer players in a two-dimensional simulated environment. In this paper, we present our team’s work in developing advanced algorithms for marking, blocking, shooting, dribbling, and other soccer-related behaviors. Our algorithms are designed to work collaboratively to create effective team strategies and tactics for winning matches in the Soccer Simulation 2D game. Through rigorous testing and experimentation, we have optimized our algorithms to improve our team’s performance and increase our chances of success in the competition. Our research in this field has the potential to contribute to the advancement of autonomous robotic systems and the development of intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks.

### [Yushan2023](./YuShan_SS2D_RC2023_TDP.pdf)
- 📄 **Title**: YuShan2023 Team Description Paper for RoboCup2023
- ✍️ **Authors**: Zekai Cheng, Yahui Ren, Chao Liu, Junmin Huang, Jingya Wang, Ye Zhu, Liang Zhang 
- 📜 **Abstract**: This team description paper introduces YuShan2023's team optimization directions and methods over the past year. The passing module is one of the important modules of the team, and an effective passing strategy will improve the overall strength of the team. Since the parameters of the passing module are too complicated and the data distribution is too heterogeneous, in order to be able to classify the passing data effectively, we propose a method based on kernel density negative example learning, which improves the classification effect of different kinds of passing feature data by parsing the game log files. Based on the classification results, the key areas of the offense are extracted to realize the optimization of the decision logic of the team's passing strategy, and certain improvements are achieved in tests with several teams.
